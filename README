*** HOW TO USE ? ***

1 - Upload your NodeXL graph to Google Spreadsheets taking note of the spreadsheet key in the url 
2 - File > Publish to the web ... 
3 - Pointing your browser to index.html#SPREADSHEET_KEY

*** COMPATIBILITY ***

NodeGL uses the canvas element, which might cause compatibility issues with older browsers.

It has been tested with the latest Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer versions.

It doesn't work with Internet Explorer 8 or older.

*** KNOWN ISSUES ***

Graph shapes are ignored (replaced by circle)

You may have trouble using the viewer if you launch it from a local drive, as some browsers consider loading files from disk via Ajax to be unsecure.
It usually works with Firefox, but not with Chrome. In Internet Explorer you'll have a security pop-up asking you to "Allow blocked content".

Another solution is uploading it to a server, where it should work correctly.
